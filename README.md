# Reinforcement-Learning-in-Portfolio-Management
This is a repository for my research in reinforcement learning in portfolio management. We will design a RL trader to trading a portfolio which can take transaction cost into account.
We will build backtest on FAANG campany's stocks and FAANG_EW_benchmark.ipynb shows a benchmark of eqully weighted long only portfolio management strategoes. It uses the bt - flexible backtesting for Python package http://pmorissette.github.io/bt/.
